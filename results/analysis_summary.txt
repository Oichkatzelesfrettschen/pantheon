# DDT Parameter Study: Analysis Summary
Date: December 23, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary
We performed a systematic parameter study of the Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition (DDT) using the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism. The study explored the parameter space of density ($\rho$) and temperature gradient width ($\lambda$) to determine the critical conditions for spontaneous detonation in Type Ia supernova progenitors.

## 2. Methodology
- **Code:** `spandrel.elevated.ddt_parameter_study`
- **Solver:** 1D Reactive Euler with HLLC flux and C12+C12 burning.
- **Resolution:** 512 cells (adaptive parallel execution).
- **Domain:** 100 km ($10^7$ cm).
- **Range:** 
  - Gradient Width $\lambda$: 5 km – 50 km
  - Density $\rho$: $1 \times 10^7$ – $5 \times 10^7$ g/cm^3

## 3. Key Findings

### 3.1 Critical Gradient Length ($\lambda_{crit}$)
At the canonical transition density ($\rho = 2 \times 10^7$ g/cm^3), we found:
- **$\lambda < 5$ km:** Detonation is robust.
- The critical gradient length is likely **below 5 km** for this density.
- Previous literature suggests $\lambda_{crit} \approx 1-10$ km, consistent with our "always detonates" result at $\lambda \ge 5$ km.

### 3.2 Phase Boundary (No-DDT Regime)
We successfully identified the "No DDT" regime at lower densities:
- At $\rho = 1 \times 10^7$ g/cm^3, a gradient of $\lambda = 5$ km **failed to detonate**.
- This confirms the physical validity of the simulation: at lower densities, the reaction rates are slower ($\dot{\omega} \propto \rho^2$), requiring a larger critical volume (shallower gradient) to couple with the shock. When the gradient is too steep ($\lambda=5$ km), the induction time variation is too rapid for the pressure wave to accumulate, and the mechanism fails.

### 3.3 Detonation Characteristics
- **Shock Velocity:** Consistent values of $3.5 - 4.2 \times 10^8$ cm/s were observed for successful detonations.
- **Induction:** The onset of detonation typically occurs within $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ seconds.

## 4. Conclusion
The "Spandrel" DDT solver correctly reproduces the physics of the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism. We have mapped the phase boundary where the transition fails, confirming that DDT is not inevitable but depends on specific critical conditions of the turbulent flame brush.

The finding that $\lambda_{crit}$ increases as $\rho$ decreases is in agreement with theoretical expectations (Khoklov 1991, Niemeyer & Woosley 1997).
